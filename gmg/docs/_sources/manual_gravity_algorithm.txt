**A1 Bott (1965) 2D gravity algorithm**
=======================================

Two dimensional gravity anomalies are calculated using a python implementation of Bott's (1969) :cite:`bott1969`
algorithm. This is similar to that derived by Talwani et al., (1959) :cite:`talwani1959` and operates by setting the
observation point as the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system and treating the periphery of a given body as an
n-sided polygon, defined by of discrete set of nodal points. The total gravity anomaly is then calculated by evaluating
the solution for a semi-infinite horizontal slab with one sloping interface for each set of nodal pairs and then summing
the results. The analytic solution for this is given by Heiland (1940) :cite:`heiland1940` page. 153 as:

.. math:: \Delta g = 2 G \Delta\rho \left[ - \left\{ x_{1} \sin \theta + z_{1} \cos \theta \right\} \times
    \left\{ \sin \theta \log_{e} \frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}} + \cos \theta (\phi_{2}-\phi_{1}) \right\} +
    z_{2}\phi_{2} - z_{1}\phi_{1} \right]
    :label: bott_algorithm

Where G is the Universal Gravitational Constant; `\Delta\rho` is the density contrast between the polygon and the
surrounding material; :math:`x_{i}`, :math:`z_{i}` and :math:`r_{i}` are the horizontal, vertical and absolute distance
between each node and the observation point, :math:`P`, respectively; `\theta` is the angle between the sloping edge and
the horizontal; and :math:`\phi_{i}` is the angle between the x-axis and :math:`r_{i}` respectively. The geometry of
this parametrisation is shown in :numref:`bott_method`.

The total gravity anomaly produced by a given polygon is then determined by moving progressively counter-clockwise
around the polygon and summing the contribution of each side (Equation :eq:`bott_sum`).

.. math:: \Delta g = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \Delta g_{i}
    :label: bott_sum

When :math:`$z_{2} > z_{1}$` the contribution is positive and when :math:`$z_{2} < z_{1}$` the contribution is
negative, such that, in the summation, the contributions outside of the polygon cancel, leaving only the gravity
anomaly produced by the polygon itself (:numref:`bott_method`).

The Bott (1969) :cite:`bott1969` algorithm is preferred to the Talwani et al., (1959) :cite:`talwani1959` because a) it
runs slightly faster and b) it does not explicitly require closed polygons.

    a) An example of a infinite slab with one sloping horizontal side, showing the geometric values relative to the
    observation point (0,0) using in solving Equation :eq:`bott_sum`. b) Example of calculating the gravity anomaly due
    to a two dimensional body (red dashed line) estimated using five nodes (A-E) by summing the effects of the five
    infinite slabs with sloping sides (modified after, Kearey et al., (2013) :cite:`kearey2013`).


Bott (1965) algorithm testing
-----------------------------

To assess the accuracy of the Bott (1969) :cite:`bott1969` method, the gravity anomaly determined using the algorithm is
compared to that of an exact analytic solution for a simple body. In this case, the solution for a buried horizontal
cylinder of constant density contrast, that extends infinitely into and out of the model plane is used. The solution
for this case is given by, for example, Garland (1965) :cite:`garland1965` Pg. 70 as:

.. math:: g_{z} = 2 \pi G r^{2} \Delta\rho \hspace{2pt} \frac{z}{x^{2}+z^{2}}
    :label: garland

.. figure:: _static/grav_cylinder.png

    Two-dimensional geometric parameters required for calculating the gravity anomaly produced by a
    buried cylinder.

Where :math:`G` is the Universal Gravitational Constant; :math:`r` is the radius of the cylinder; :math:`\Delta\rho` is
the density contrast between the cylinder and the surrounding material; and :math:`x` and :math:`z` are the horizontal
and vertical distances from the observation point, :math:`P`, to the centre axis of the cylinder respectively. The
geometry of this parametrisation is shown in :numref:`grav_cylinder`.

Using the Bott (1969) :cite:`bott1969` algorithm, the cylinder must be estimated using a series of discrete nodal
points, :math:`N`. A range of values for :math:`N` were tested, starting from :math:`N = 360` (i.e., one node every
1 degree) and then halving the number of nodes for each new test until :math:`N = 22` (i.e., one node every
:math:`\sim` 16 degrees). For the :math:`N = 360` case, the predicted anomaly is also calculated using the Talwani et
al., (1959) :cite:`talwani1959` method for comparison. This method uses a slightly different trigonometric
parametrisation.

As can be seen in Figure :numref:`gravity_anomaly_comparison`, both the Bott (1969) :cite:`bott1969` and
Talwani et al., (1959) :cite:`talwani1959` methods produce almost identical anomalies, with the slight
( :math:`2.9 \times 10^{-6}` ) mismatch resulting from the difference between the sum of precision error, due to the
different trigonometric functions that are solved by each algorithm. When :math:`N = 360`, both methods reproduce the
analytic anomaly to within an RMS misfit :math:`9.0 \times 10^{-4}` mGal. For the :math:`N = 22` case the  Bott (1969)
:cite:`bott1969` method predicts the analytic solution to within 0.25 mGal. This level of accuracy is adequate for
modelling large scale features, for example, sedimentary basins and lithospheric gravity anomalies and demonstrates
that bodies constructed using simplified geometries with relatively few nodes, are sufficient for modelling of such
features. However, for some applications, such as microgravity surveys, much higher accuracy is required and detailed
polygons with many nodes may be necessary.
