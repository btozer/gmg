**2.0 Model Layers**
====================

------------------
2.1 Adding a layer
------------------

To add a new layer to the model navigate to the *'Layers'* menu and select *'New Layer'*::

    Layers -> New Layer -> New fixed layer
                        -> New floating layer

Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut, **n** key.

You will be prompted with the option of adding a *'New fixed layer'* or a *'New floating layer'*.

**Floating layers:**

Floating layers are polygons that are fully contained within the model space. For example, a narrow salt dome.

..warning:

    Floating layer nodes must be input **counter clockwise** otherwise the calculated anomaly will have the wrong sign!

**Fixed layers:**

Fixed layers span the entire width of the model and are useful for modelling features such as sedimentary basin
formations. Fixed layers have fixed boundary nodes that can only be moved vertically along the model edges.

..note:

    Fixed layers are automatically *'padded'* horizontally from the boundary nodes by an additional 400 km in order to
    avoid edge effects.

--------------------------------
2.2 Adding a new node to a layer
--------------------------------
To add a node to a layer: Place the mouse cursor at the position where you would like to add the new node and
press the *'i'* key to insert the new node.

.. Note:: Nodes are inserted to the right of the currently selected node (which is highlighted red).

--------------------------------
2.3 Deleting a node from a layer
--------------------------------
To delete a node from a layer: Place the mouse cursor over the node you would like to delete and
press the *'d'* key to delete the node.

------------------
2.4 Pinching nodes
------------------
"Pinching" refers to "snapping" a node onto a node of another layer so that they are "stuck" together.

There are two ways to pinch nodes together:

1. To pinch a single node, press the *p* key to activate pinch mode. Now select the node you wish to pinch,
then switch to the layer which you would like to pinch to, finally click on the node to pinch to.

2. Alternatively, multiple nodes can be pinched or depinched simultaneously to the layer above or below
(as defined in the layer order list) by selecting *'Pinch Layer'* in the Menubar. A distance range over which to
pinch/depinch nodes can then be entered.

2.5 Deleting a layer
--------------------
To delete a model layer, in the Menubar navigate to::

    Layers -> Delete Current Layer...
