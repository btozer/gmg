**1.0 Introduction**
====================

By following this tutorial the user will learn how to use GMG by working through loading and modelling of an example dataset.

We will cover all the steps required to create a 2D subsurface model based on the gravity and magnetic
anomalies produced by the Weardale granite in the Northern Pennines, UK. Thereby, recreating the study
published by the British geophysicist Martin Bott (Bott, 1967) :cite:`bott1967`.

The tutorial will walk through the following steps::

    1. Creating a new 2D model.

    2. Saving and reloading a model.

    3. Loading observed 2D profile data (both Bouguer gravity and magnetic anomalies) into the GMG modelling
       environment.

    4. Loading borehole horizon tops into your model.

    5. Adding new layers to your model and assigning attributes such as bulk density and magnetic susceptibility to them.

    6. Setting magnetic field attributes in your model (e.g. the strength of Earth's field and the elevation of data acquisition).

    7. Loading a 2D seismic reflection profile into you model.

    8. Running forward model calculations of the predicted gravity, vertical gravity gradient and magnetic anomalies.

    9. How to use the GMG interface to forward model gravity and magnetic anomalies.

    10. How to save the predicted anomaly profiles as external text files.

    1. How to produce a raster figure and save this to disc using GMGs inbuilt figure production module.


**1.1 Geologic background**

The Weardale granite is located in the Northern Pennines, Northern England. The presence of this Caledonian-aged
granite was first proposed by Dunham (1934) as a means of explaining observed lead-zinc mineralization in nearby
outcrops. Later, gravity and magnetic surveys conducted by various authors strongly corroborated this suggestion and
Bott (1967) :cite:`bott1967` collated these data and published the regional maps shown in figures
:numref:`bouguer_gravity_map` and :numref:`magnetic_map`. The granites presence was then confirmed with the
drilling of the Rookhope borehole (Dunham et al., 1961). The location of this borehole is shown as the yellow circle
in :numref:`bouguer_gravity_map` and :numref:`magnetic_map`.

In this tutorial, we will model the subsurface structure of this granite based on the gravity and magnetic anomalies as
well as structural and physical constraints provided by other data sources. Namely, (1) the Rookhope borehole;
(2) geological surface outcrops and (3) A *fictional* depth migrated seismic reflection horizon.

**1.2 Defining the model profile**

Our model profile runs south to north from A-A* with a total length of 50 km. The profile start and end coordinates (in British
National Grid format; EPSG code: 27700) are::

    A  = 393956 E 521000 N
    A* = 393956 E 571000 N

    Bouguer gravity anomaly contoured at 1 mGal increments
    (digitized from figure 2 of Bott (1967) :cite:`bott1967`). The red line A-A* shows the profile we will model in this
    tutorial and is chosen to intersect the Rookhope well (yellow circle). Note map coordinates are British
    National Grid Projection [EPSG code: 27700].

    Areo-magnetic anomaly map acquired at an average elevation of 305 m above the ground surface. This survey was flown 
    with a line spacing of 2 km and is contoured at 10 nT increments.  Note map coordinates are British
    National Grid Projection [EPSG code: 27700].
