**13.0 Benchmark examples**
===========================

To test the potential field algorithms employed within gmg, two benchmark models are 
provided for comparison with the analytical solutions for simple two dimensional shapes.

13.1 Gravity benchmark
----------------------

Please see :doc:`A1 <manual_gravity_algorithm>` for details regarding the 2D gravity anomaly algorithm
used within gmg. The example shown in this description can be replicated by the user using
the files::

    grav_cylinder_node.txt  - Nodes representing the diameter of a buried cylinder
    grav_cylinder_analytical_anomaly.xa   - THe predicted anomaly from this cylinder, given a density contrast of 250 kg m^-3

13.2 Magnetic benchmark
