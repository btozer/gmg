**4.0 Loading observed profile data**
=====================================

Now we have creating our model, we can load the observed gravity and magnetic anomaly data into the modelling
environment. First, lets load the gravity data by navigating to::

    Gravity -> Load Gravity Anomaly...

Now select the **File...** button and use the file explorer to navigate to and select the file
**bott_Bouguer_gravity.xg**. This file is located in the directory::

    gmg/docs/tutorial/GRAVITY_DATA

Now lets name the data **Bouguer anomaly** and leave the display color as the default **blue**. Finally, select the
**Load** button to load the data.

You should now see the observed Bouguer gravity anomaly in the Gravity panel.

Lets repeat this process for the magnetic anomaly data **bott_Magnetic_anomaly.xm** located in the directory::
