**1.0 Modelling**
=================

------------------------
1.1 Creating a New Model
------------------------

Before creating a new model, it is recommended that you create a project directory structure in which you will store
and save all of the data related to the model. This can be structured in any way the user wishes, however, the
directory structure outlined in this section is a useful template. First create a new root directory for your project::

    mkdir GMG_MODEL

Then::

    cd GMG_MODEL

and create the following directory structure::

    mkdir MODELS GRAVITY_DATA MAGNETIC_DATA SEGY_DATA WELL_DATA GEOLOGICAL_DATA POINT_DATA EXPORTS FIGURES

You are now ready to start modelling. Launch gmg and navigate to::

    File -> New Model...

A pop-up window will appear in which you will enter the new model's dimensions and the spacing increment
at which the predicted anomalies will be calculated (NB. all units are km).

.. Note::

    The model dimensions and spacing at which potential field data is calculated can be modified later by navigating
    to::

        Model View -> Modify current Model Dimensions...

.. Tip::

    If you require a very fine spatial resolution for the predicted anomaly increment (relative to the total length of
    the model), then it may be computationally beneficial to set the spacing as a relatively coarse value for initial
    modelling, and then later reduce this to the fine spacing required for the final model. This will ensure gmg runs
    smoothly during the initial modelling phase.

------------------
1.2 Saving a Model
------------------

To save a model use the Save model icon (see :ref:`icons`) or navigate to::

    File -> Save Model...

This will prompt a save file menu, from which you can navigate to the directory where you would like to save your model.
For example: gmg_testing/MODELS/

gmg models are saved as *Pickle* files and must have a ".model" suffix, for example:

    gmg_model_01.model

.. Tip::

    It is recommended that the user incrementally saves updated models using a incremented suffix such as:

    model_1.model

    model_02.model

    ...etc

This will ensure you can revert back to previous models if you "corrupt" your current model, or it becomes a "dead end".

-------------------
1.3 Loading a Model
-------------------

To load a model use the Load model icon (see :ref:`icons`) or navigate to::

    Files -> Load Model -> navigate to your required .model -> Open

Your model will be loaded into the current gmg window.
