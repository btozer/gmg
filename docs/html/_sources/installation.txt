Installation
============

Pre-Installation
----------------

.. note::

    gmg is written in Python 3 and can be installing using common python package managers 
    conda (from conda-forge) or pip. Installation and launching of the software involves 
    the use of a command line terminal, but this is minimal and should be manageable for a non-expert
    by following the instructions below.

**Step 1: Install Miniforge**

If you don't aleady use miniforge or anaconda for managing and installing python packages, then 
the simplest way to install gmg is to first install Miniforge (a minimal installer for `Conda <http://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_
specifically for `conda-forge <http://conda-forge.org>`_).

This should ensure you can install all the dependencies required on any platform (Linux, Mac, Windows) using the Conda
package manager.

**Step 2: Create a new conda environment for gmg**

It's best to create a new conda environment to use when running GMG. This will avoid any potential conflicts. e.g.::

    conda create -n gmgpy

Where the -n flag dictates what you want to name the new environment (you can call the environment whatever you like
but the documentation will use the name gmg-env).

On macOS and Linux this environment can then be activated using::

    conda activate gmgpy

Or on Windows use::

    activate gmgpy

Once the environment is activated any call to python will only "see" the packages install within the gmg-env
environment. To deactivate the environment either close the terminal window or on macOS and Linux run::

    conda deactivate

Or on Windows use::

    deactivate

**OS Support:**

GMG is currently only tested on macOS Monterey, Ubuntu 22.04 Linux and Windows 11 operating systems. It is possible
that issues may arise when trying to install on other distributions. Please raise any information regarding
installation problems on github.

Installing gmg
--------------

THe gmg package is hosted on both conda-forge and PyPi (pip). It is highly recommended that
you install gmg in a standalone conda environment using option 1 below. This is ensure
you do not create any dependencies issues that may arise if you install system-wide using pip.

First, ensure your gmgpy conda environment is active. On macOS or Linux use::

    source activate gmgpy

Or on Windows use::

    activate gmgpy

**Installation option 1: using conda (highly recommended)**

    conda install gmgpy

**Installation option 2: using pip**

    pip install gmgpy

Launching gmg
-------------

after installation, make sure you are using a terminal with your gmgpy environment active 
(i.e., conda activate gmgpy), then, gmg can be launched from your terminal command line using::

    gmgpy
 
The splash screen and model shell should appear as shown below:
