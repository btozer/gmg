**8.0 Geologic data**
=====================

Geologic data refers to locations of geological surface features such as 
outcrops, unit boundaries or faults.

**8.1 Loading geologic data**
-----------------------------
To load a geologic record select the *Outcrop Data* menu in the Menubar and select *Load Outcrop Data...**
Then, navigate to the file containing the geologic record to load.  

.. note::
    These files should be ASCII text files formatted as shown in the example below file. The header
    line can be labelled however the users wishes but the columns must be formatted as following:
    Column 1:X coordinate; Column 2:Z coordinate for the top of the feature icon; 
    Column 3:Z coordinate for the base of the feature icon; Column 4: Label to display above icon.
    All coordinates are in km (same as the model frame). 

Example file containing the locations where fault traces intersect the model profile::

   #X(km)   Z1(km)  Z2(km)  NAME
