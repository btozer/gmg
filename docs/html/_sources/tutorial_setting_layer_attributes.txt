**7.0 Setting layer attributes**
================================

Now that we have created a new floating layer to represent the Weardale granite, lets assign it a bulk density so that
we can model its gravity effect. We will also assign a ``background density`` used to represent the surrounding basement
rock. The difference between these two values represents the ``density contrast`` used for calculating the gravity
effect of the granite.

Kimbell et al., (2011) :cite:`Kimbell2011` suggest that 2.78 :math:`g cm^{-3}` is a reasonable bulk density for the
Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the ``Alston Block``, within which the Weardale granite was emplaced. While measurements made
on rock fragments of the granite itself, recovered from the Rookhope borehole, suggest its bulk density is close to
2.63 :math:`g cm^{-3}` (Bott, 1967) :cite:`bott1967`.

Lets use these values to begin our modelling. To set the bulk density of the granite::

    First, select the ``Weardale`` layer under the menu by double clicking on its name. We can now set the bulk density
    and reference density values under the ``Layer Attributes`` top left control panel. Once you have assigned the
    values click ``Set layer attributes`` to make the changes.
