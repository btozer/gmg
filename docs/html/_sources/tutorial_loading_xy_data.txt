**7.0 Adding XY data**
=======================

We can load XY data points into the model frame by using the ``*XY Data*`` menu located in the Menubar. XY data can be
used to represent any subsurface data type, for example, earthquake hypocenters. In this case we will load in
seismic reflection horizon ``picks`` take from a depth convert seismic reflection profile (Note these picks are
hypothetical and were created specifically for use in this tutorial).

We will load two ``horizons``. The first is taken from the top of a band of reflectivity interpreted to represent the
base of the Weardale granite. The second is take from the base of the same band of reflectivity. Together, these
horizons place bounds on the depth of the base of the granite.

To load these XY data, navigate to::

    XY Data -> Load XY Points...

Now select the **File...** button and use the file explorer to navigate to and select the file
**Weardale_seismic_reflection_picks_top_depth_converted.xy**. This file is located in the directory::

    gmg/docs/tutorial/XY_DATA

Repeat this process for the file **Weardale_seismic_reflection_picks_bottom_depth_converted.xy**.

There are several faults in this region across which the thickness of the sedimentary rocks varies significantly.
Lets load some hypocenter locations to help map these structures (again, these data are hypothetical and were created
specifically for use in this tutorial).

Repeat the XY data loading process, but this time, lets load the file **Weardale_eqs.xy**.
