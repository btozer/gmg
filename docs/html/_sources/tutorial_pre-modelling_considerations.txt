**2.0 Pre-modelling data processing and considerations**
========================================================

As we are interested in modelling the structure of the Weardale granite, important preprocessing steps 
prior to forward modelling the gravity and magnetic anomalies is to consider other factors contributing to 
the total field anomalies.

One common preprocessing step when modelling near surface structure using potential field data, is to preform a separation of the "regional" component of the anoamly 
from the total anomaly in order to remove the contribution from the longer wavelength regional signal (which may be sourced, for example, from the juxerposition of 
different basement terranes). Because these anomalies are generated from deep sources, they are of much longer wavelength than the anomaly produced 
by our target strucuture, which resides in the upper crust.

==============================
*2.1 Residual gravity anomaly*
==============================

There are several different strategies for calculating regional anomalies. For the gravity data we will use the regional gravity feild 
as determined by :cite:`Kimbell2011` as shown in :numref:`regional_gravity_map`. As can be seen in this figure, there is a long
wavelength positive anomaly in this region with amplitudes ranging :math:`\sim` :math:`14-21` :math:`mGal`.

We will simply subtract this long wavelength component from the total anomaly, to produce the residual Bouguer anomaly as shown 
in :numref:`residual_gravity_map`. We will model this residual signal to estimate the subsurface structure of the Weardale granite.

    Regional gravity anomaly related to long wavelength density anomalies from :cite:`Kimbell2011`. The
    red line A-A* shows the profile we will model in this tutorial and is chosen to intersect the Rookhope well
    (yellow circle). Note map coordinates are British National Grid Projection [EPSG code: 27700].

*2.1 Continuous Reduction To the Pole magnetic anomaly*
=======================================================

In order to model the magnetic anomaly, we'll first convert apply a Continuous Reduction To the 
Pole (RTP) operation on the grid. The purpose of this is to simplify the interpretation of the anomaly by
transforming the anomaly so that it appears as if it were observed at the geomagnetic pole, such that 
the subsurface bodies are magnetized vertically see, for example, .
