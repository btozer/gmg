**1.0 Introduction**
====================

In this tutorial you will learn how to use GMG by working through an example.

We will cover all the steps required to create a 2D subsurface model based on the gravity and magnetic
anomalies produced by the Weardale granite in the Northern Pennines, UK. Thereby, recreating the study
published by the British geophysicist Martin Bott (Bott, 1967) :cite:`bott1967`.

The tutorial will walk through the following steps::

    1. Creating a new model and how to save and reload models.

    2. Loading observed 2D profile data (both Bouguer gravity and magnetic anomalies) into your GMG modelling
       environment.

    3. Loading borehole horizon top data into your GMG modelling environment.

    4. Adding new layers to your model and assigning attributes (e.g. bulk density) to them.

    5. Setting magnetic field attributes in your model (e.g. the strength of Earth's field).

    6. Running forward model calculations of the predicted gravity and magnetic anomalies.

    7. How to use the GMG interface for forward modelling.

    8. How to save the predicted anomaly profiles as external text files.

    9. How to produce a raster figure and save this to disc using GMGs inbuilt figure production module.

    10. How to load 2D seismic reflection data into a model.

**1.1 Geologic background**

The Weardale granite is located in the Northern Pennines, in Northern England. The presence of this Caledonian-aged
granite was first proposed by Dunham (1934) as a means of explaining observed lead-zinc mineralization in nearby
outcrops. Later, gravity and magnetic surveys conducted by various authors strongly corroborated this suggestion and
Bott (1967) :cite:`bott1967` collated these data and published the regional maps shown in figures
:numref:`bouguer_gravity_map` and :numref:`magnetic_map`. The granites presence was finally confirmed with the
drilling of the Rookhope borehole (Dunham et al., 1961). The location of this borehole is shown as the yellow circle
in :numref:`bouguer_gravity_map` and :numref:`magnetic_map`. In this tutorial, we will model the subsurface structure
of this granite based on the gravity and magnetic data as well as structural and physical constraints provided by other
data  sources. Namely, (1) the Rookhope borehole; (2) geological surface outcrops and (3) *fictional* seismic reflection
horizon picks.

**1.2 Defining the model profile**

Our model profile runs south-to-north with a total length of 50 km. The profile start and end coordinates (in British
National Grid format; EPSG code: 27700) are::

    A  = 393956 E 521000 N
    A* = 393956 E 571000 N

    Land based Bouguer gravity anomaly contoured at 1 mGal increments
    (digitized from Bott (1967) :cite:`bott1967` Fig. 2). The red line A-A* shows the profile we will model in this
    tutorial and is chosen to intersect the Rookhope well (yellow circle). Note the map uses the British
    National Grid projection [EPSG code: 27700].

    Areo-magnetic anomaly map acquired at an average elevation of 305 m above the ground surface, flown with a line
    spacing and 2 km and contoured at 10 nT increments. Note the map uses the British
