**1.0 Introduction**
====================

This tutorial aims to familiarise the user with the core functionality of GMG by systematically working through the loading and 
modelling of an example dataset.

The data we will work with span the Weardale granite located in the Northern Pennines of North England (Fig. :numref:`location_map`).
We will model the subsurface structure of this feature based primarily on the Bouguer gravity anomaly, thereby 
replicating previous studies of this region, including that published by the British geophysicist 
Martin Bott in 1967 (Bott, 1967) :cite:`bott1967`. We will also use the magnetic anomaly and other auxiliary datasets 
(a borehole record, geological information and  a *fictional* depth migrated seismic reflection horizon) 
to help better constraint the subsurface model and lean how this can be integrated within the GMG modelling environment. 


The tutorial will walk through the following steps::

    1. Opening GMG and creating a new 2D model.

    2. Saving and reloading the model.

    3. Importing observed 2D profile data (both gravity and magnetic anomalies) into 
       the GMG modelling environment.

    4. Importing borehole horizon tops into your model.

    5. Adding new layers to your model and assigning attributes such as bulk density and 
       magnetic susceptibility to them.

    6. Setting magnetic field attributes in your model (e.g. the strength of Earth's field 
       and the elevation of data acquisition).

    7. Importing XY data points into your model (in ths case we will load points 
       representing a 2D seismic reflection horizon).

    8. Running forward model calculations of the predicted gravity, vertical gravity 
       gradient and magnetic anomalies.

    9. How to use the GMG interface to forward model gravity and magnetic anomalies.

    10. How to save the predicted anomaly profiles as external text files.

    11. How to produce a raster figure and save this to disc using GMGs inbuilt figure 
        production module.


**1.1 Geologic background**

The Weardale granite is located in the Northern Pennines, Northern England (Fig. :numref:`location_map`). The presence of 
this Caledonian-aged granite was first proposed by Dunham (1934) as a means of explaining observed lead-zinc mineralization in nearby
outcrops. Later, gravity and magnetic surveys conducted by various authors strongly corroborated this suggestion and
Bott (1967) :cite:`bott1967` collated these data and published the regional maps shown in figures
:numref:`bouguer_gravity_map` and :numref:`magnetic_map`. The granites presence was then confirmed with the
drilling of the Rookhope borehole (Dunham et al., 1961). The location of this borehole is shown as the yellow circle
in :numref:`bouguer_gravity_map` and :numref:`magnetic_map`.

    with a line spacing of 2 km and is contoured at 10 nT increments. The white line X-X' shows the profile we will model in this
    tutorial. This is chosen to intersect the Rookhope borehole/ Note map coordinates are British
