Then, navigate to the file containing the well record to load.

    can contain any user defined metadata. This example includes the well coordinates and elevation.
    The record then contains the elevation of the well top, X position in model coordinates and then
    the horizon names and depths. Note the unit used for elevation and horizon depths must be km 
    (same as the model frame).
