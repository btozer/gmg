**13.0 Benchmark examples**
===========================

To test the potential field algorithms employed within gmg, two benchmark models are 
provided for comparison with the analytical solutions for simple two dimensional shapes.

13.1 Gravity modelling benchmark: Buried cylinder
-------------------------------------------------

Please see :doc:`A1 <manual_gravity_algorithm>` for details regarding the 2D gravity anomaly algorithm
used within gmg. The example shown in this description can be replicated by the user using
the files stored in demos/GRAVITY::

    24_nodes_cylinder_layer.txt
        - A layer with 24 nodes representing the circumference of a buried cylinder

    360_nodes_cylinder_layer.txt
        - A layer with 24 nodes representing the circumference of a buried cylinder
    
    grav_cylinder_analytical_anomaly.xa
        - The predicted anomaly from this cylinder (density contrast 250 kg m^-3)

**Step 1: Create a new model**

Once you have opened GMG create a new model by navigating to the Menubar and selecting::

    File -> New model...

In this example, we'll create a spanning x=0 to x=50 km and z=0 to z=15 km 
and the calculation increment as 0.1 km. 

**Step 2: Load the observed gravity anomaly**

Load the observed gravity anomaly. This was calculated using the analytical solution for a 
buried cylinder extending infinitely in the 3rd dimension (Heiland (1940) :cite:`heiland1940` Pg. 153).

To load observed anomaly navigate to *Gravity* in the Menubar. Next, select *Load Gravity Anomaly*. 
Now, navigate to the file *grav_cylinder_analytical_anomaly.xa* and select it::

    Gravity -> Load Gravity Anomaly -> Select file to load

Finally, give your observed anomaly a name, for example, *observed_anom*.

**Step 3: Load a discretised representation of a buried cylinder**

Now, load a gmg layer representation of the buried cyclinder used to calculate the observed anomaly.

To load the layer, navigate to *Layers* in the Menubar. Next, select *Load Layer...*. Finally,
navigate to the file *24_nodes_cylinder_layer.txt* and select it.

The cylinder layer, consisting of 24 nodes, should appear in within your model.

**Step 4: Set the density contrast**

Under the right hand *Layer Attributes* window navigate to *density* and set the value as 0.25 (i.e., 250 :math:`kg\ m^{-3}`).
The click the *Set* button.

**Step 5: Turn on the gravity calculator**

In the Toolbar find the *G* button (third in from the left). This is used to switch the gravity response 
calculation on and off. Click the button and the calculated anomaly will appear in the gravity frame.

Note there is a slight mismatch between the observed and calculated anomaly near the peak. This is due 
to the missing mass around the edge of the cylinder, given we have dicretised it with a series of straight lines.

**Step 6: Calculate the root-mean-square misfit**

In order to assess the goodness of fit between the observed and calculated anomaly, a simple root-mean-square (RMS) 
misfit may be calculated by navigating to::

    Gravity -> Set RMS Input...

Now, select your observed anomaly as the input file. You'll see the RMS value, 0.1979 mGal, is now displayed in the *Statusbar* 
at the base of the modelling frame. The RMS as a function of distance along the transect will also be displayed as 
a purple line in the gravity data frame.

**Step 7: Test the difference using a more accurate cylinder representation**

Now, lets try loading the layer file *360_nodes_cylinder_layer.txt* in the same way we did in **Step 3**. Again,
set the density contrast as 250 :math:`kg\ m^{-3}`. Both cylinders will now be contributing to the calculated gravity 
response, so, the RMS value will be large. Try switching off the contribution from layer 1 by unchecking its tick box under the
*Layers* window. We see now the RMS value decreases to 0.0007 mGal, much reduced relative to the previous value. This is 
because we have added most of the mass missing from the
cylinder discretised with only 24 nodes. 


13.2 Magnetic benchmark
-----------------------

Please see :doc:`A2 <manual_magnetic_algorithm>` for details regarding the 2D magnetic anomaly algorithm
used within gmg. 

To benchmark the magnetic anomaly algorithm we can, similarly to as done above for the gravity algorithm, compare 
the anomaly produced by the algorithm with an analytical solution for a buried cylinder. In the case of a 
magnetic anomaly this solution is given by, for example, Sleep & Fujita (1997) Pg. 223 eq. 6.45 :cite:`sleep1997`.

anomaly[i] = mc * (r**2) * ( (((x[i]-x1)**2) - z2) / (2 * ((((x[i]-x1)**2) + z2 )**2)) )  ## S&F97

.. math::

    \Delta T = \f \kappa r^2 (\x-\x+1)^2 - z^2)

where :math:`\Delta T` is the magnetic anomaly, :math:`r` is the radius of the cylinder, :math:`\Delta \chi` is the

The files for this comparison can be found in the directory demos/MAGNETICS. The files are as follows::

    magnetic_cylinder_analytical_anomaly.xa
        - The predicted anomaly from this cylinder (magnetic susceptibility 0.001)

In this example, the analytical solution was calculated using a magnetic susceptibility of 0.001. 
The Earth's magnetic field was set as 50,000 nT, both
magnetic declination and inclination were 0 degrees and the model profile was assumed to run North-south
(i.e., angles A, B and C are all equal to zero). 

**Step 1: load the observed magnetic anomaly**

We will continue with the model created for the gravity benchmark test as outlined above.

To load observed magnetic anomaly, navigate to *Magnetics* in the Menubar. Next, 
select *Load Magnetic Anomaly...*. 
Now, navigate to the file *mag_cylinder_analytical_anomaly.xa* and select it::

    Magnetics -> Load MAgnetic Anomaly -> Select file to load

Finally, give your observed anomaly a name, for example, *observed_anom*.

**Step 2: Set the magnetic properties for each layer**

With layer 1 (i.e., the 24 node cylinder) selected, navigate to 
*Susceptibility* under the right hand *Layer Attributes* window and set the value as 0.001. 
Now, leave angles A, B and C as zero and set F (Earth's field) as 50,000. Finally, click the *Set* button.

**Step 3: Turn on the magnetic calculator**

In the Toolbar find the *M* button (fifth in from the left). This is used to switch the magnetic response 
calculation on and off. Click the button and the calculated anomaly will appear in the magnetics frame.

Note, similarly to the gravity anoamly there is a slight mismatch between the observed and calculated anomaly 
near the peak. Again, this is due to the missing mass around the edge of the cylinder, 
given we have dicretised it with a series of straight lines.

**Step 4: Calculate the root-mean-square misfit**

In order to assess the goodness of fit between the observed and calculated anomaly, a simple root-mean-square (RMS) 
misfit may be calculated by navigating to::

    
    Magnetics -> Set RMS Input...

Now, select your observed anomaly as the input file. You'll see the RMS value, 0.0445 nT, is now displayed in the *Statusbar* 
at the base of the modelling frame. The RMS as a function of distance along the transect will also be displayed as 
a purple line in the gravity data frame.

**Step 5: Test the difference using a more accurate cylinder representation**

Select layer 2 (i.e.,  the 360 node cylinder) and set it's susceptibility to 0.001 and f to 50,000 nT. 
Now, switch off the contribution from layer 1 by unchecking its tick box under the *Layers* window. 
We see now the RMS value decreases to 0.0002 nT. As with the gravity anoamly, this much reduced relative 
to the previous value, as we have added most of the mass missing from the cylinder discretised with only 24 nodes.


13.3 Summary
------------

These tests have demonstrated the accuracy of the gmg algorithms. The RMS values calculated for the 
gravity and magnetic anomalies are very small for the 24 node discretisation and negligible for the 360 node case. 

It is hoped that these tests have provided the user with a feel for the accuracy and limitations of 
the 2D algorithms incorporated within gmg (For example, the accuracy of the calculated anomaly is 
dependent on the number of nodes used) and provided a quick and easy introduction to key features within 
the software. 

.. note::
   
    The algorithms used within gmg are currently 2D implementations. As such, the calculated anomalies
    assume all model layers extend infinitely in the 3rd dimension. This can result in an underestimation
    of, for example, a layers density contrast, as it's infinite extent will result in a larger gravity 
    response to that of a finite length body. Incorporating extent-limited (i.e., 2.5D) algorithms 
    is a key focus of future development.
