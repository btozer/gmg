**10.0 Python console**
=======================

A python console can be accessed from within GMG and allows users to access the underlying objects
from within the modelling environment. To open the python console select the python icon from the
controlbar in the bottom left of the GUI. 

The user can then follow the instructions listed at the top of the terminal to access GMG. Ie.,

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    gmg = sys.gmg

Objects can then be accessed via python. For example, to return the location of the x nodes for
layer 1 the user could use the following:

.. code-block:: python

    gmg.layer_list[1].x_nodes
